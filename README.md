# Optimizing-MINDWALC-Node-Classification-to-Extract-Interpretable-Decision-Trees-from-KGs

This python project was created as part of the article 
"_Investigating and Optimizing MINDWALC Node Classification to Extract Interpretable Decision Trees from Knowledge Graphs_".

The MINDWALC optimizations proposed in the article are implemented in the original MINDWALC repo (https://github.com/predict-idlab/MINDWALC).

This Project contains the scripts used to generate the results in the article.

## Requirements and Installation

### 1) Install MINDWALC

To use this project, you need to install the latest MINDWALC package. 
Currently, MINDWALC is not available on PyPi, so you need to install it manually.

For this, please first clone the MINDWALC repo (https://github.com/predict-idlab/MINDWALC) into another directory.

To avoid git issues, delete the ````.git```` folder in the MINDWALC directory.

Then, copy the MINDWALC directory into the root directory of this project.

Check the ````MINDWALC/README.md```` for installation instructions and make sure that the MINDWALC 
is working properly by running the example script in ```MINDWALC/mindwalc/Example (AIFB).ipynb```.

### 2) Install the required python packages

Create a new environment, then install the required python packages with:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
